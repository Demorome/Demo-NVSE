# Questions-&-Answers

This is a series of questions that generally get asked on pages for other NVSE plugins.

Q. Does this mod replace JIP LN NVSE Plugin, JohnnyGuitar NVSE, and SUP NVSE?\
A. No, ShowOff does not replace those plugins. It is meant to be installed and used alongside them.

Q. Will you support NVSE 5.1.4?\
A. No. Due to features in xNVSE that this plugins need, it is not feasible to support legacy versions of NVSE.

If you have anymore questions, feel free to join us on the [xNVSE community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EebN93s). 

# Permissions
All releases are free to be used by anyone.\
As for redistribution or taking code from this plugin for your own use...

Keep in mind that much of the ShowOff NVSE code is taken from others .\
I (Demorome) try to make it clear from where such code came from.\
If you want to use code I took from someone else, you should ask the original creator for permission.\
Besides that, you may use any of my code anywhere without asking for my permission, so long as you credit me.

# Credits
Kormakur, lStewieAl, c6, Luthien, TommInfinite, Jazzisparis, karut - for their invaluable help and the code I stole off all of them.

Code has been taken from the following plugins:
* [JohnnyGuitar NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927)
* [JIPLN NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277) 
* [lStewieAl's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347)
* [SUP NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71878)

This plugin wouldn't be possible without everyone who contributed to (x)NVSE, and who made the example plugin.

* xNVSE and the example plugin are available here: https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE
* The original NVSE is available here: http://www.nvse.silverlock.org/
