# Questions-&-Answers

This is a series of questions that generally get asked on pages for other NVSE plugins.

Q. Does this mod replace JIP LN NVSE Plugin, JohnnyGuitar NVSE, and SUP NVSE?\
A. No, ShowOff does not replace those plugins. It is meant to be installed and used along side them.

Q. Will you support NVSE 5.1.4?\
A. No. Due to features in xNVSE that this plugins need, it is not feasible to support legacy versions of NVSE.

Q. My Anti-virus says this mod is a virus. Is this true?\
A. No, it is a false positive. Due to the way NVSE plugins work, some AVs flag them as malicious. Be sure to add an exception in your anti-virus.

# Credits
Kormakur, lStewieAl, c6, Luthien, TommInfinite, Jazzisparis, karut - for their invaluable help and the code I stole off all of them.

Code has been taken from the following plugins:
* [JohnnyGuitar NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927)
* [JIPLN NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277) 
* [lStewieAl's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347)
* [SUP NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71878)

This plugin wouldn't be possible without everyone who contributed to (x)NVSE, and who made the example plugin.

* xNVSE and the example plugin are available here: https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE
* The original NVSE is available here: http://www.nvse.silverlock.org/
