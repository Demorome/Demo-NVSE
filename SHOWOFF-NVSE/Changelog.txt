This file is here just so I'm reminded to keep track of changes as I do em.


//===v1.00 - too lazy to add right now

//===v1.05 - same deal


//===v1.10

-Semi-major refactorings (file inclusion was changed around, behaviors hopefully shouldn't change)
-Fixed GetCalculatedEquippedWeight and GetBaseEquippedWeight expecting an int "minWeight" instead of a float.
-GetCalculatedEquippedWeight - Fixed nullptr issue (caused crashes if no weapon was equipped)
-GetCalculatedEquippedWeight - Fixed "Modify Light Items" adjustement not being calculated per-reference (used to only care about if the player had the effect)
-For GetCalculatedEquippedWeight / GetBaseEquippedWeight / GetNumBrokenEquippedItems:
	*Fixed items being counted multiple times if they had multiple equip slots.
	*Added two new flags: skipUnplayable and noQuestItems
	*DEFAULT BEHAVIOR CHANGED: In order to avoid including unplayable items like the pipboy by default-calling the function, 
		`skipUnplayable` is automatically checked if Flags == 0 (or not provided).
		(This also applies to the new GetEquippedItems/UnequipItems functions)

-New Functions:
* SetShowOffDebugMode
* GetShowOffDebugMode
* UnequipItems
* GetEquippedItems
* IsBaseForm
* SetRandomizerSeed
* SetSeedUsingForm
* GetRandomizerSeed
* RandSeeded
* GetRandomPercentSeeded
* IsReferenceCloned
* AdvanceSeed

//===v1.15

===Misc:
* When the game starts, there is now a console print that says if ShowOff is running and what version it's at.
* Optimized GetEquipped__ functions.

===DEFAULT BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
*GetEquipped__ functions now account for items that have no equip slots (I didn't realize they could be equipped), no matter what the equip slot filters are.
In order to filter those out, there is now a new flag: NoSlotlessItems

===Bug Fixes:
* Fixed certain GetEquipped__ functions always printing to console
* Add RandSeeded safety check (Min must be <= Max) - before, breaking this assertion caused a crash. Returns -1 if this assertion fails.
* Fix GetRandomizerSeed returning NAN (returns -1 for errors now).

===New Functions:
* IsTemporaryReference - this should be kept undocumented, I didn't sufficiently test it.
* GetPCHasScriptedFastTravelOverride
* GetPCCanFastTravel
* WeaponHasFlag
* ActorHasBaseFlag
* RemoveAllItemsShowOff


//===v1.17

===New Functions:
* ForceWeaponJamAnim
* DisableAlt
* EnableAlt
* GetCalculatedSkillPoints
* GetLevelUpMenuPoints
* ToggleQuestMessages


//===v1.20

===Bug Fixes:
* ToggleQuestMessages now also silences quest objective messages.
* GetLevelUpMenuPoints now accounts for iLevelsPerPerk gamesetting (and skipping getting perks each level or so). Thanks Stewie!

===New Functions:
* GetCalculatedPerkPoints
* GetLevelUpMenuCurrentPage
* SetLevelUpMenuCurrentPage
* ShowPerkMenu


//===v1.25

*AS OF THIS VERSION, xNVSE 6.2.3 or greater is required.*

===Changes:
* GetNumActorsInRangeFromRef and GetNumCombatActorsFromActor both have a new OnlyDetectedActors filter flag.
* GetCreatureTurningSpeed and GetCreatureFootWeight are made available as condition functions.
* Added alias to GetNumBrokenEquippedItems -> GetNumBrokenEq 

===Bug Fixes:
* Nada

===New Functions:
* Get/SetExplosionRefSource
* Get/SetExplosionRefRadius
* CreateFolder (made by anhatthezoo!)
* GetActorValueDamage (alias: GetAVDamage)
* GetEquippedItemRefs
* SetShowOffOnCornerMessageEventHandler

===WIP (registered but unfinished)
* ShowSkillMenu
* GetLevelUpMenuUnspentPoints
* SetLevelUpMenuCanExitEarly
* SetLevelUpMenuPoints
* GetPipboyRadioVoiceEntryData  ; quite buggy atm
* Set/GetNoEquipShowOff (alias: Set/GetNoEquipSO)



//===v1.30

===Bug Fixes:
*Fix conflict with Stewie's Tweaks that broke bNoCrippleCriticalMessages=1 + g_bPatchCripple=1. 

===New Functions:
*Get/SetIngestibleConsumeSound
*SetFactionCombatReactionTemp
- The above is still registered, but was split in two for readability:
	*SetAllyTemp (alias: SetAllyShowOff)
	*SetEnemyTemp (alias: SetEnemyShowOff)
*GetEquippedItemRefForItem
*TopicInfoGet/SetResponseStrings
*(WIP functions from last update are still not done, sorry!)

===Credits:
-Trooper for documenting and suggesting SetAlly/EnemyTemp
*lStewieAl for helping fix the conflict.
